I read an investigation from "Animal Político" [talking about how people were selling private and super sensitive personal information](https://www.animalpolitico.com/2022/04/padron-electoral-a-la-carta-asi-se-venden-tus-datos-personales-en-la-red/). That information was collected from the "INE", a Mexican government institution that must keep that data safe; however, I realized that we actually never own our own personal information. It is always in others' hands. Whenever a leak occurs, the institutions/companies/organizations only say something like "oops, that shouldn't happen" or "Please update your password because we've been hacked". At least to me, it seems like nothing happened, well, the bad PR. Still, as far I know, there isn't a strict regulation on top of that; at least it doesn't exist in México. Here's where ssa wants to help with technology by creating an encrypted file stored in the user's computer to keep the user's information and allow apps to request access.
